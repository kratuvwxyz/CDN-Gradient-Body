# gradientBody
Add background with changing rainbow colors.

This project provides a JavaScript file that creates a smooth, transitioning rainbow-colored background. The background cycles through modern rainbow colors with a smooth blending effect every 3 seconds, offering an aesthetically pleasing backdrop for web applications.

## Features
- Automatically transitions through a series of modern rainbow colors
- Smooth color blending effect with no flickering or black screens
- Customizable and easy to integrate

## Usage

To use this background effect in your project, simply add the following `<script>` tag to your HTML file. This includes the JavaScript directly from the CDN.

### CDN Link

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kratuvwxyz/CDN-Gradient-Body@1.0.1/CDN-Gradient-Body.js"></script>
```

### Example HTML Setup

Here’s a basic example of how to use this script in an HTML file to get a smooth rainbow background effect:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Smooth Rainbow Background</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Enjoy the Smooth Rainbow Colors!</h1>

  <!-- Include the CDN link here -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kratuvwxyz/CDN-Gradient-Body@1.0.1/CDN-Gradient-Body.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## How It Works

The JavaScript file applies a color-changing effect to an overlay that covers the entire background. It cycles through a sequence of rainbow colors, smoothly transitioning every 3 seconds.
